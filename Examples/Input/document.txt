Firewall Lab
├── ​Today's Lab
│   ​├── ​https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/379547/assignments/3374867?module_item_id=10672102
│   ​├── ​Goals
│   ​│   ​└── ​You are going to build a set of firewall rules to provide certain desired behaviors.
│   ​├── ​Key Tools
│   ​│   ​├── ​ifconfig
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​Tells you about the various internet connections a system has
│   ​│   ​├── ​telnet
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​Lets you send super basic data / commands over the internet on the specified port
│   ​│   ​└── ​netcat
│   ​│   ​    ​└── ​bare-bones telnet, executes single commands and does not provide a terminal
│   ​└── ​𝗘𝗦𝗦𝗘𝗡𝗧𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗖𝗢𝗡𝗦𝗜𝗗𝗘𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡
│   ​    ​├── ​It is possible to create a firewall that locks you out of your own system!
│   ​    ​└── ​Always make sure to not block traffic to your dev client!
│   ​    ​    ​└── ​A good way to do this is to include a rule near the top of your firewall rules that always gives you access no matter what.
├── ​Attendance
│   ​├── ​Totally new System
│   ​│   ​├── ​Permanent Attendance Form - https://forms.gle/n7CGi8s5VqHgNj7K7
│   ​│   ​├── ​A TA will hand you a random hex code on paper on your way out the door.
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​You will not be allowed to re-enter the classroom once you leave with this code.
│   ​│   ​└── ​Turn this code in at any point over the next 72 hours along with the other info the form asks for.
│   ​├── ​Notes on the Code
│   ​│   ​├── ​There are only 60 valid codes each week out of 4 billion possibilities.
│   ​│   ​├── ​If the same code is used twice, both students who used it will receive a 0.
│   ​│   ​└── ​If a submission contains no code or an invalid code, the student will receive a 0.
│   ​└── ​Apologies
│   ​    ​├── ​I know this is kind of dumb and extra, for the 99% of you who have been following the rules, I'm sorry.
│   ​    ​└── ​For the 1% of you who are behaving dishonestly, look at what you've done!
├── ​Lecture Participation
│   ​├── ​Weeks 12 and 13 have been graded.
│   ​├── ​Very poor participation, this is a super easy way to raise your grade!
│   ​└── ​𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬 𝗡𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗦
│   ​    ​├── ​Some people have not received participation because they still have not set their display names in slack.
│   ​    ​├── ​𝗜𝗦 𝗧𝗛𝗜𝗦 𝗬𝗢𝗨?
